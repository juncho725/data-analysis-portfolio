## 🚀 Project List

### 1️⃣ [Healthcare Data Pipeline Construction (0→1)](./01.healthcare-data-pipeline-0to1/)
**Key Achievement**: Built complete dataset of 600,000 records from analysis-impossible state

- **Problem**: No raw data access, only 100-patient sampling possible
- **Solution**: Analyzed 140 SQL files to understand system, then built complete automation
- **Technology**: SQL complex joins, Python large-scale data processing, medical workflow modeling
- **Impact**: 6,000x data expansion, established company-wide data-driven decision-making system

### 2️⃣ [KPI Comparative Analysis (2023 vs 2024)](./H1-KPI-Analysis-2023-2024/)
**Key Achievement**: Business performance analysis through statistical validation

- **Purpose**: Year-over-year core metric trend analysis and statistical significance testing
- **Analysis**: Patient acquisition, repurchase rate, customer profile changes
- **Technology**: T-test, confidence interval analysis, time-series comparison
- **Insights**: Patient volume decreased but customer quality improved (repurchase rate↑, purchase amount↑)

### 3️⃣ [A/B Testing: Split Prescription Effect Analysis](./03.healthcare-Data-AB-Testing/)
**Key Achievement**: Quantitative measurement of healthcare service improvement effects

- **Experiment**: 3-month batch prescription vs 1.5-month split prescription effect comparison
- **Metrics**: BMI reduction rate, repurchase rate, customer referral rate
- **Technology**: Mixed-Effects Model, F-test, Z-test
- **Purpose**: Validate impact of enhanced patient care on treatment outcomes

### 4️⃣ [MySQL Backup Automation](./04.mysql-backup-automation/)
**Key Achievement**: 93% time savings from daily manual work 30min → 2min

- **Problem**: Daily manual application of multiple branch DB backups
- **Solution**: Complete automation using Python scheduler
- **Technology**: MySQL integration, scheduling, error handling
- **Effect**: Error prevention, time savings, automated monitoring

### 5️⃣ [Potential Customer Reactivation Analysis](./05.non-purchaser-reactivation/)
**Key Achievement**: Discovered new marketing opportunities from unutilized data

- **Discovery**: Large volume of potential customer data from inquiry-only, non-purchasing customers
- **Strategy**: Sophisticated target customer identification through cross-validation
- **Technology**: Complex filtering, customer journey analysis, optimal timing derivation
- **Result**: Established new marketing channel after legal review completion
